The corrected code addresses the generic type mismatch by using `natural` instead of `integer`:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity my_entity is
  generic (
    g_width : natural := 8  -- Corrected: Using natural
  );
  port (
    a : in  std_logic_vector(g_width-1 downto 0);
    b : out std_logic_vector(g_width-1 downto 0)
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of my_entity is
begin
  b <= a;
end architecture; 
```
By using `natural`, the code ensures that only non-negative values are passed as the generic `g_width`, preventing any issues stemming from the range incompatibility between `integer` and the array indexing used in the code.
