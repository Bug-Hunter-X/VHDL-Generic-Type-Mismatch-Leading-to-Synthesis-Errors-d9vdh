In VHDL, a subtle but impactful error can occur when using generics with the incorrect type.  For instance, if a generic is declared as an integer but is used in a context expecting a natural number, synthesis might fail or produce unexpected results. This is because the range of integers includes negative numbers whereas naturals are only non-negative. This difference, often overlooked, might only become evident during simulation or synthesis, creating debugging challenges.

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity my_entity is
  generic (
    g_width : integer := 8  -- Incorrect: Should be natural
  );
  port (
    a : in  std_logic_vector(g_width-1 downto 0);
    b : out std_logic_vector(g_width-1 downto 0)
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of my_entity is
begin
  b <= a;
end architecture; 
```
